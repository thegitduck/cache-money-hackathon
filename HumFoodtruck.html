                            <p>Welcome to our foodtruck finder app!  Simply put, we are just a bunch of tech interns that are crazy passionate about food.  Recently, we have been tasked with creating and executing an idea for the 2019 Humanathon.  Therefore, we decided to dabble in the field of foodtrucks.....I mean who doesn't love foodtrucks?!  Our app will make foodtruck foodies have a better experience when it comes to finding their favorite foodtruck.  Enjoy!</p>
